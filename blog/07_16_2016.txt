Hey there, I'm Collin. This is my first post! I'll use it as a short bio to explain a bit more about who I am and what I do...

Born and raised in Boston, I'm a rising Junior at Northwestern University studying Materials Engineering and Computer Science. Here, I'm the Director of Individual Tutoring for NU|Tutors, a student run company that grosses over $70,000 annually, run on the club track team, and have played around with starting a few companies — I sold my first when I was in high school.

This summer, I'll be working at Infrared5 building simple tools for developers who want to create live streaming applications. Last summer, I helped start-up Splitzee reduce the pain of group payments by creating the first social money application. I've also stepped into the investment banking world with boutique firm AGC Partners, where I worked with analysts and partners alike to close several multi-million dollar acquisitions.

I've worn some different shoes, for sure, but with each pair I come one step closer to figuring out which fit me best — And I'm having a blast along the way!
